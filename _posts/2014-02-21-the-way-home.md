## who are you again, the way home

i like how you can be anyone online if you do it right

your ability to comment and browse seems more comfortable

feels like the way home


## tools and tips on how to move about:

# tools

* TOR
* PGP
* TrueCrypt
* VPN
* KeePass

# tips

using the right tools can help you stay un watched online but its almost as important ( if not more ) to be aware of your browsing habits

while your big brother might not be standing behind you your parents can still be watching your network taffic

either way try not grab too much attention

and while most of this you should already know its still intresting to see how everyone can be anyone online

it feels like the way home
